<h1> Vending Machine Application</h1>
<p>In this pair-programming project, Jason Ronis and I created a command-line application that mimics the properties 
  and functionality of a vending machine.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vending machine inventory is stocked via an input file (CSV); inventory includes chips, candy, beverages, and gum.</li>
  <li>The vending machine must be able to display a list of items to the user, including name, price, and 
    quantity remaining in the machine.</li>
  <li>The user must be able to feed the machine money, choose items to purchase, end the transaction and get change.</li>
  <li>All monetary transactions must be logged in a text file for auditing purposes.</li>
  <li>Unit tests should be provided wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
