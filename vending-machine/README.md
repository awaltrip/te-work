<h1>Vending Machine Application</h1>
<p>In this pair-programming project, Jason Ronis and I created a command-line application that mimics the properties 
  and functionality of a vending machine.</p>
<p>Requirements can be found <a href="https://github.com/awaltrip/te-work/blob/master/vending-machine/Module%201%20Capstone-Vending%20Machine%20Terminal.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vending machine inventory is stocked via an input file (CSV); inventory includes chips, candy, beverages, and gum.</li>
  <li>The user can choose to have the machine display a list of items, including name, price, and 
    quantity remaining in the machine.</li>
  <li>The user can feed the machine money, choose items to purchase, end the transaction and get change.</li>
  <li>All monetary transactions are logged in a text file for auditing purposes.</li>
  <li>JUnit tests are included.</li>
</ul>
